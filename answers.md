#Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.

RDBMS = Relational DataBase Management System. Many flavors, are a tool that help with managing and visualizing SQL databases.
SQL = Structured Query Language. A standard that is implemented in many forms.

#Why do tables need a primary key?

The primary key is used to identify rows in a table. It must be unique. Without a primary key, you wouldn't be able to get specific rows out of a table.

#What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

Foreign Key

#What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

We can create a new table with two foreign keys that reference the primary keys of the two tables.
